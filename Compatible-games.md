**2.****Intro only means nothing but an intro/opening of the game is shown** (such as a video/animation/company name/etc.)

**3.****Loadable with FPS, but shows nothing means that the game is capable of being read but can't actually start/run yet**

**4.Intro/title screen only means that you can load the game, control it somewhat, but can't actually get past title screens**

## An unfinished list of commercial PS2 games & their compatibility/status on Play!:

**1.****In-game means somewhat playable past title screens** (including with graphics bugs, crashes, and other major problems)

**2.****Intro only means nothing but an intro/opening of the game is shown** (such as a video/animation/company name/etc.)

**3.****Loadable with FPS, but shows nothing means that the game is capable of being read but can't actually start/run yet**

**4.Intro/title screen only means that you can load the game, control it somewhat, but can't actually get past title screens or can't get playable in-game**

**5.****Nothing/crash means that the game won't even be read by the emulator and/or crashes the emulator before the game even gets to show much of anything**

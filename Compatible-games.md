## An unfinished list of commercial PS2 games & their compatibility/status on Play!:

**1.** **In-game** means somewhat playable past title screens (including with graphics bugs, crashes, and other major problems).

**2.** **Menu/Title screen only** means that you can load the game, control it somewhat, but can't actually get past title screens or can't get playable in-game.

**3.** **Intro only** means nothing but an intro/opening of the game is shown (such as a video/animation/company name/etc.).

**4.** **Loadable with FPS, but shows nothing** means that the game is capable of being read but can't actually start/run yet.

**5.** **Nothing/Crash** means that the game won't even be read by the emulator and/or crashes the emulator before the game even gets to show much of anything.
